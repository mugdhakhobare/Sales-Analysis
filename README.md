# Sales-Analysis
This project analyzes Q4 2020 sales data for AAL, an Australian apparel brand, to support strategic expansion.
The project involves data wrangling, descriptive statistical analysis, and data visualization to evaluate state-wise and demographic-wise sales performance. Interactive dashboards highlight high- and low-revenue states, group-wise sales trends, and time-based patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly), enabling data-driven decision-making for sales strategy optimization and business expansion.
